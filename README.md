### AI for the Arts and Humanities Portfolio

This lab book documents my learning journey through the AI for Arts & Humanities course. Its purpose is to demonstrate how I developed foundational skills in Python, critically engaged with AI tools such as Microsoft Copilot, and built confidence in interpreting, annotating, and reflecting on code. The exercises will help me understand not only how Python code works, but why certain structures are useful, and how AI can support computational thinking. The lab book also acts as evidence of reflective practice, showing my problem-solving process, my interactions with AI tools, and my growing ability to connect abstract programming concepts to real-world applications.

  ## Aims

- To create a styled and easy to read portfolio.
- To build my confidence in coding programmes.
- To produce code that works well.
- Learn how to use AI tools (e.g., Copilot) responsibly.
- Prepare for later machine-learning tasks
