    "**Overview of my proposed application:**\n",
    "I designed a tool that combines a machine-learning model with a large language model to generate personalised explanations of predicted student performance. The goal is to promote transparent educational analytics, support student reflection, and reduce anxiety by making predictions understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>How it works:</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple regression model predicts a student’s final grade based on features like:\n",
    "- study time\n",
    "- absences\n",
    "- parental support\n",
    "- health\n",
    "- prior grades\n",
    "\n",
    "The ML model outputs a numerical prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM converts this into:\n",
    "- a human-friendly explanation\n",
    "- a breakdown of influential factors\n",
    "- personalised suggestions for improvement\n",
    "- warnings about model bias or limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Why this is useful:</u>\n",
    "- This design helps students understand academic progress\n",
    "- Reduces the intimidation of raw algorithmic output\n",
    "- Encourages self-reflection\n",
    "- Supports teachers in communicating feedback\n",
    "- Raises awareness of fairness, bias, and responsible AI"
