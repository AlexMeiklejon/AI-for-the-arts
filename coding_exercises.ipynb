    "**Initial Prompt:**\n",
    "What are functions and why are they important?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copilot Response:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A function is a named block of code that carries out a particular job.\n",
    "- It can take inputs (parameters), process them, and often give back an output (return value).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are functions important?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Organization & clarity:* Functions break a big program into smaller, manageable pieces. Each piece has a clear purpose, which makes the whole program easier to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reusability:* Once you write a function, you can use it multiple times without rewriting the same code. For example, a calculate_tax() function can be reused whenever tax needs to be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Avoid repetition:* Without functions, you’d have to copy-paste the same code everywhere. Functions let you write it once and call it whenever needed, reducing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Collaboration:* In team projects, different people can work on different functions. This modular approach makes teamwork smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Debugging & maintenance:* If something goes wrong, you only need to fix the function in one place. This makes troubleshooting much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Scalability:* As programs grow, functions help keep complexity under control. They act like mini-programs inside the larger program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I then asked Copilot the same prompt again, to see if it would provide an answer with different or new information:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Prompt:**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Copilot Response:**\n",
    "- A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
    "- Think of it like a recipe: you give it ingredients (inputs), it follows steps (the code), and it produces a dish (the output).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Initial Prompt:** How does Python decide whether a condition is True or False behind the scenes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copilot Response:** Python uses a concept called truthiness to decide whether a condition is True or False. Here’s what happens behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "***1. Every condition becomes True or False***\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python sees something like if x > 5:, it evaluates x > 5 first. That comparison returns either True or False. If it’s True, the block runs; if it’s False, Python skips it.\n",
    "\n",
    "***2. Truthiness rules***\n",
    "\n",
    "Not everything is a direct comparison. Python uses truthiness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Empty things (empty string \"\", empty list [], empty dict {}, zero 0, and None) are considered False.\n",
    "Non-empty things (non-empty strings, lists, numbers other than zero) are considered True.\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "\n",
    "if \"Hello\": runs because \"Hello\" is non-empty → True.\n",
    "if \"\": does not run because \"\" is empty → False.\n",
    "\n",
    "***3. Comparisons return Boolean values***\n",
    "Operators like ==, <, > always return True or False. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "10 == 10 → True\n",
    "5 > 8 → False\n",
    "\n",
    "***4. Internal conversion***\n",
    "\n",
    "Python internally calls bool(expression) to decide. If bool(expression) is True, the block runs; if False, it doesn’t.\n"

    "### Basic Python Syntax and Style\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Prompt:**  \n",
    "Could you use the examples you have provided above to explain basic syntax of Python to a complete beginner in programming? Please explain step-by-step highlighting any key aspects. Please include well known references to Python styling guides.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copilot (condensed explanation):**  \n",
    "Copilot explained that **syntax** is the set of rules Python follows to understand and run code. Using my earlier examples (Hello, world!, variables, lists, dictionaries, functions, loops, classes), it highlighted these core ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Print and strings**\n",
    "  - `print(\"Hello, world!\")` calls a function with parentheses.\n",
    "  - Text values are written in quotes: `\"...\"` or `'...'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables and types**\n",
    "  - `message = \"Hello\"` uses `=` to assign a value to a name.\n",
    "  - Python has basic types like `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `str`.\n",
    "  - Variable names normally use `snake_case` (e.g. `user_name`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indentation and blocks**\n",
    "  - Indentation (typically **4 spaces**) defines blocks of code.\n",
    "  - Lines ending with `:` start a block: `if`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`.\n",
    "  - Everything inside the block is indented underneath.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lists and dictionaries**\n",
    "  - Lists use square brackets: `[\"Hello\", \"Hi\"]` and are indexed from 0.\n",
    "  - Dictionaries use curly braces and key–value pairs:\n",
    "    `{\"English\": \"Hello\", \"Spanish\": \"Hola\"}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions**\n",
    "  - Defined with `def name(...):` and use `return` to send back a value.\n",
    "  - Example: `def greet(name): return f\"Hello, {name}!\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classes, objects, and methods**\n",
    "  - `class Greeter:` defines a blueprint.\n",
    "  - `__init__` sets up each new object (e.g. storing a `name`).\n",
    "  - Methods are functions inside a class that use `self`, e.g. `def say_hello(self):`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Operators**\n",
    "  - `+` and `*` work on both numbers and strings:\n",
    "    - Numbers: `2 + 3`, `4 * 5`.\n",
    "    - Strings: `\"Hello \" + \"world!\"`, `\"Hi! \" * 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copilot also pointed me to Python style guides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code:**  \n",
    "  Recommends 4-space indentation, readable spacing (`a + b`), short lines, and clear naming.\n",
    "- **PEP 257 – Docstring Conventions:**  \n",
    "  Explains how to document functions and classes with triple-quoted strings.\n",
    "- **The Zen of Python (`import this`):**  \n",
    "  A collection of short principles like “Readability counts” and “Simple is better than complex”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Copilot emphasised that good Python code is not just correct, but also **readable** and **consistent**, so that other people (and my future self) can understand it easily.\n",

Each topic built on the last, helping me see how small, simple pieces of syntax can combine into more structured programs. Working through step-by-step examples with Copilot allowed me to explore multiple variations of the classic “Hello, world!” program, each highlighting a different programming principle, from readability and reusability to safety and user inclusivity. I also learned the importance of coding style and conventions through references to PEP 8 and other established guides, which helped me write cleaner, more consistent code. Overall, this process strengthened both my technical confidence and my ability to reflect on how and why certain patterns are used in real Python development."

    "- Yes the code ran well! I used the code Copilot gave me but carefully tweaked it once it was in my codespace to properly fit my assignment schedule and due dates. I found this very helpful for planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Did it do what I expected?** \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes — the program behaved almost exactly as my pseudocode described. Copilot correctly interpreted my steps about identifying urgent assignments first and then falling back to the most effort-intensive task. The output matched what I intended: it selected the assignment due soonest when there was an urgent one, and otherwise picked the highest-effort task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only small discrepancy was that Copilot initially suggested sorting the entire list of assignments rather than checking deadlines first and then effort levels. I clarified that I wanted a two-stage decision, not a single combined ranking. After I explained this, Copilot quickly revised the code to match my planned logic. The updated version ran without errors and produced the expected result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What worked well / less well with Copilot?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Worked well:\n",
    "- Copilot translated my high-level pseudocode into working Python very quickly, without me needing to specify every detail.\n",
    "- It suggested appropriate data structures (lists of dictionaries) that matched what I had already learned in the earlier sections of the lab book.\n",
    "- When I clarified my intention, it updated the code efficiently and explained why it made certain choices.\n",
    "- My group also noticed that Copilot was good at adding small improvements, like using lambda with min() and max(), which none of us would have thought of on our own yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worked less well:\n",
    "- Sometimes Copilot assumed a different data format than the one I wrote in my pseudocode, so the first version of the code didn’t match exactly — for example, it assumed numerical effort scores instead of my descriptive labels (“low”, “medium”, “high”).\n",
    "- It occasionally produced code that was more advanced than we needed at this stage. My group commented that while it was correct, it sometimes introduced concepts (like sorting or comprehensions) that made the solution harder to read for beginners.\n",
    "- We also found that Copilot sometimes skipped explanations unless prompted directly, so we had to ask additional questions to fully understand why it wrote the code the way it did.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this exercise helped me see the connection between:\n",
    "- everyday algorithms,\n",
    "- pseudocode,\n",
    "- and real Python programs,\n",
    "and how Copilot can support each stage—but still requires me to read, test, and refine the code carefully.\n"

The goal was not to run the code, but to recognise familiar Python concepts I have learnt about (imports, variables, printing, loops, etc.) within small example snippets. This helped me understand how digital humanities and AI systems treat media as numerical or structured data that can be read, analysed, or transformed by a machine.\n",
