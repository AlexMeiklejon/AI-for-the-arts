    "### Functions\n",

    "Firstly, I wanted to ask Copilot more about functions so I can understand what they are and what they do:\n",

    "**Initial Prompt:**\n",
    "What are functions and why are they important?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copilot Response:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A function is a named block of code that carries out a particular job.\n",
    "- It can take inputs (parameters), process them, and often give back an output (return value).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are functions important?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Organization & clarity:* Functions break a big program into smaller, manageable pieces. Each piece has a clear purpose, which makes the whole program easier to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reusability:* Once you write a function, you can use it multiple times without rewriting the same code. For example, a calculate_tax() function can be reused whenever tax needs to be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Avoid repetition:* Without functions, you’d have to copy-paste the same code everywhere. Functions let you write it once and call it whenever needed, reducing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Collaboration:* In team projects, different people can work on different functions. This modular approach makes teamwork smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Debugging & maintenance:* If something goes wrong, you only need to fix the function in one place. This makes troubleshooting much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Scalability:* As programs grow, functions help keep complexity under control. They act like mini-programs inside the larger program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    I then asked Copilot the same prompt again, to see if it would provide an answer with different or new information:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Prompt:**\n",
    "What are functions and why are they important?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copilot Response:**\n",
    "- A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
    "- Think of it like a recipe: you give it ingredients (inputs), it follows steps (the code), and it produces a dish (the output).\n",
    "- In Python, you define a function with def and call it by its name.\n",
    "\n",

    "aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copilot Response:** Copilot explained that I firstly need to define a function: def make_greeting(name): this creates a reusable block of code named make_greeting. The part in parentheses, name, is a parameter—an input the function expects.\n",
    "Then I make a function body: Inside the function, we build the text in message. This code runs only when the function is called, not when it’s defined.\n",
    "Next create a return value: return message sends the finished result back to wherever the function was called. Without return, the function does work but doesn’t hand back a value.\n",
